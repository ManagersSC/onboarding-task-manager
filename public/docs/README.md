## What This Platform Covers

The Smile Cliniq platform handles **two connected systems**:

1. **Hiring / ATS** — Track candidates from first application through to being hired. Managed directly in Airtable. Automatic emails fire at each stage (interview invite, welcome email, rejection, etc.).

2. **Onboarding Task Manager** — Once a candidate is hired, the web app manages their onboarding: tasks, document uploads, quizzes, and notifications. Accessible at `onboarding-task-manager.vercel.app`.

Both systems share the same Airtable database. See [Platform Overview](system-overview) for the full picture.

## About This Guide

This documentation is written in two layers:

- **Admins and staff** — Start with [Hiring Guide](hiring-guide) and [Operations Manual](operations-manual). These explain what to click, what the system does automatically, and what to do when something goes wrong.

- **Developers** — Start with [Technical Overview](technical-overview) and [Make.com Scenarios](automations). These document the architecture, automation flows, and reconnection instructions.
