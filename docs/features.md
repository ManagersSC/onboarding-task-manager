## Task Management: Refresh Button

**Feature Added:** Refresh Button in Task Management UI

- **Location:** In the Task Management component header, to the left of the "New Task" button.
- **Icon:** Uses the `RefreshCw` icon from lucide-react.
- **Purpose:** Allows users to manually refresh and refetch the latest tasks from the backend without reloading the page.
- **Usage:**
  - Click the "Refresh" button to reload the task list.
  - The button is styled as an outlined button for clear distinction.

**Developer Note:**
- The button calls the `fetchTasks` function, which re-fetches tasks from `/api/dashboard/tasks` and updates the UI accordingly.
- This improves user experience by providing a quick way to sync the task list with backend changes.

## Notification System & Task Completion Logic

### Overview
The notification system ensures users are promptly informed about important events in the onboarding workflow, such as task assignments, completions, updates, deletions, and document uploads. Notifications are delivered in-app and, based on user preferences, via Email and Slack (integrated through Make.com).

### Notification Types
- **Task Assignment:** When a user is assigned a new task.
- **Task Completion:** When a task is completed.
- **Task Update:** When a task is edited/updated.
- **Task Deletion:** When a task is deleted.
- **Document Upload:** When new documents are uploaded to a task.

### Delivery Channels
- **In-App:** All notifications are stored in the Airtable `Notifications` table and shown in the app UI.
- **Email & Slack:** If enabled in the user's notification preferences, notifications are also sent to Make.com, which relays them to Email and/or Slack.

### User Preferences
- Each staff user can configure which notification types and channels they wish to receive (see the `Notification Preferences` and `Notification Channels` fields in the Staff table).
- The backend respects these preferences and only delivers notifications accordingly.

### Notification Scenarios

The system uses the `createNotification` utility to deliver notifications to users based on their preferences and actions in the system. Below are all the main scenarios where notifications are triggered:

#### 1. New Task Assignment (Staff/Applicant)
- **When:** A new task is created and assigned to a staff member or applicant (including onboarding and custom tasks).
- **Who is Notified:** The assigned staff member or applicant.
- **Notification Example:**
  - Title: "New Task Assigned"
  - Body: `You have been assigned the task: "<Task Name>".`
  - Type: `Task Assignment`
  - Severity: `Info`

#### 2. Task Completion
- **When:** A task is marked as complete.
- **Who is Notified:**
  - The **task creator** (if someone else completes their task).
  - The **assigned staff** (if someone else marks their task as complete).
- **Notification Example:**
  - Title: "Task Completed"
  - Body (to creator): `Your task '<Task Name>' assigned to staff has been completed by <User>.`
  - Body (to assignee): `Task '<Task Name>' was marked complete by <User>.`
  - Type: `Task Completion`
  - Severity: `Success`

#### 3. Core Task Deletion
- **When:** A core onboarding task is deleted.
- **Who is Notified:** All users who were assigned to the deleted task.
- **Notification Example:**
  - Title: "Task Deleted"
  - Body: `A task you were assigned (ID: <Task ID>) has been deleted.`
  - Type: `Task Deletion`
  - Severity: `Warning`

#### 4. Custom Task Assignment
- **When:** An custom task is assigned to an applicant.
- **Who is Notified:** The applicant.
- **Notification Example:**
  - Title: "New Task Assigned"
  - Body: `You have been assigned the task: "<Task Name>".`
  - Type: `Task Assignment`
  - Severity: `Info`

### Notification Flow Table
| Scenario                        | Trigger/Event                | Recipient(s)         | Notification Type      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| New task assigned (staff/applicant) | Task creation/assignment     | Assigned staff/user  | Task Assignment       |
| Task marked as complete         | Task completion              | Creator, Assignee    | Task Completion       |
| Onboarding/custom task assigned | Onboarding/custom assignment | Applicant            | Task Assignment       |
| Core task deleted               | Task deletion                | All assigned users   | Task Deletion         |

- Each staff user can configure which notification types and channels they wish to receive (see the `Notification Preferences` and `Notification Channels` fields in the Staff table).
- The backend respects these preferences and only delivers notifications accordingly.

### Backend Implementation
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/dashboard/tasks` (task assignment)
  - `PATCH /api/dashboard/tasks/[id]` with `{ action: "complete" }` (task completion)
  - `POST /api/admin/tasks/create-task` (onboarding/custom task assignment)
  - `DELETE /api/admin/tasks/core-tasks` (core task deletion)
- **Logic Location:** See [`src/app/api/dashboard/tasks/[id]/route.js`](../src/app/api/dashboard/tasks/[id]/route.js), [`src/app/api/admin/tasks/create-task/route.js`](../src/app/api/admin/tasks/create-task/route.js), [`src/app/api/admin/tasks/core-tasks/route.js`](../src/app/api/admin/tasks/core-tasks/route.js).
- **Notification Utility:** See [`src/lib/notifications.js`](../src/lib/notifications.js) for delivery and preference handling.

### Extensibility & Best Practices
- The notification system is designed to be extensible for new event types and delivery channels.
- All notification types should be added to both the `Notifications` table and the `Notification Preferences` field in the `Staff` table for consistency.
- The system respects user preferences and avoids notification spam by preventing duplicate notifications for the same event.
