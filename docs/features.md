## Task Management: Refresh Button

**Feature Added:** Refresh Button in Task Management UI

- **Location:** In the Task Management component header, to the left of the "New Task" button.
- **Icon:** Uses the `RefreshCw` icon from lucide-react.
- **Purpose:** Allows users to manually refresh and refetch the latest tasks from the backend without reloading the page.
- **Usage:**
  - Click the "Refresh" button to reload the task list.
  - The button is styled as an outlined button for clear distinction.

**Developer Note:**
- The button calls the `fetchTasks` function, which re-fetches tasks from `/api/dashboard/tasks` and updates the UI accordingly.
- This improves user experience by providing a quick way to sync the task list with backend changes.

## Notification System & Task Completion Logic

### Overview
The notification system ensures users are promptly informed about important events in the onboarding workflow, such as task assignments, completions, updates, deletions, and document uploads. Notifications are delivered in-app and, based on user preferences, via Email and Slack (integrated through Make.com).

### Notification Types
- **Task Assignment:** When a user is assigned a new task.
- **Task Completion:** When a task is completed.
- **Task Update:** When a task is edited/updated.
- **Task Deletion:** When a task is deleted.
- **Document Upload:** When new documents are uploaded to a task.

### Delivery Channels
- **In-App:** All notifications are stored in the Airtable `Notifications` table and shown in the app UI.
- **Email & Slack:** If enabled in the user's notification preferences, notifications are also sent to Make.com, which relays them to Email and/or Slack.

### User Preferences
- Each staff user can configure which notification types and channels they wish to receive (see the `Notification Preferences` and `Notification Channels` fields in the Staff table).
- The backend respects these preferences and only delivers notifications accordingly.

### Task Completion Notification Logic

When a task is marked as complete, the following business rules apply:

- **Task Creator:** Always notified when their task is completed (unless they are the one completing it).
- **Assigned Staff:** Notified if someone else completes their assigned task.
- **No duplicate notifications** are sent to the same person for a single event.

#### Notification Flow Table
| Recipient      | When Notified                                      | Message Example                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Task Creator   | When their assigned task is completed by someone else | "Your task 'X' assigned to staff has been completed by [User]" |
| Assigned Staff | If someone else completes their task               | "Task 'X' was marked complete by [User]"             |

#### Example JSON Payload to Make.com
```json
{
  "title": "Task Completed",
  "body": "Your task 'X' assigned to staff has been completed by John Doe.",
  "type": "Task Completion",
  "severity": "Success",
  "actionUrl": "",
  "source": "System",
  "recipientId": "recXXXXXXXX",
  "channels": ["Email", "Slack"]
}
```

### Backend Implementation
- **API Endpoint:** `PATCH /api/dashboard/tasks/[id]` with `{ action: "complete" }` triggers the notification logic.
- **Logic Location:** See [`src/app/api/dashboard/tasks/[id]/route.js`](../src/app/api/dashboard/tasks/[id]/route.js).
- **Notification Utility:** See [`src/lib/notifications.js`](../src/lib/notifications.js) for delivery and preference handling.
- **Airtable Integration:** All notification records are stored in the `Notifications` table, and user preferences are read from the `Staff` table.

### Extensibility & Best Practices
- The notification system is designed to be extensible for new event types and delivery channels.
- All notification types should be added to both the `Notifications` table and the `Notification Preferences` field in the `Staff` table for consistency.
- The system respects user preferences and avoids notification spam by preventing duplicate notifications for the same event.
