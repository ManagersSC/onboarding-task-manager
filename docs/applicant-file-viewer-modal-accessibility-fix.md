# Applicant File Viewer Modal - Accessibility Fix

## Issue Description

The `ApplicantFileViewerModal` component was throwing accessibility errors when opened:

```
DialogContent requires a DialogTitle for the component to be accessible for screen reader users.
```

This error occurred because:
1. The modal was being rendered in the JSX even when `selectedFile` was `null`
2. The `DialogTitle` component was not guaranteed to have content
3. The modal component lacked proper validation for edge cases

## Root Cause

The accessibility error was triggered by Radix UI's Dialog component when:
- `DialogContent` is rendered without a proper `DialogTitle`
- The modal is rendered before a file is selected
- Invalid file objects are passed to the component

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Conditional Rendering in Applicant Drawer

Modified the applicant drawer to only render the modal when a file is actually selected:

```jsx
{/* File Viewer Modal - Only render when there's a selected file */}
{selectedFile && (
  <ApplicantFileViewerModal
    file={selectedFile}
    open={fileViewerOpen}
    onOpenChange={handleFileViewerClose}
  />
)}
```

### 2. Enhanced Validation in Modal Component

Added comprehensive validation to ensure the modal only renders with valid data:

```jsx
// Don't render the modal if there's no file or if it's not open
if (!file || !open) return null

// Ensure we have a valid file object with required properties
const fileUrl = file.proxyUrl || file.fileUrl || file.url
const fileName = file.name || file.originalName || "Document"

// Validate that we have the minimum required data
if (!fileName) {
  console.warn('ApplicantFileViewerModal: Invalid file object - missing name')
  return null
}
```

### 3. Guaranteed DialogTitle Content

Ensured the `DialogTitle` always has meaningful content:

```jsx
<DialogTitle className="truncate">
  {fileName || "Document Viewer"}
</DialogTitle>
```

## Benefits

1. **Accessibility Compliance**: Eliminates the screen reader accessibility error
2. **Better User Experience**: Modal only appears when there's actual content to display
3. **Error Prevention**: Prevents rendering of invalid modal states
4. **Performance**: Avoids unnecessary component rendering
5. **Maintainability**: Clear validation logic makes debugging easier

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Open the applicant drawer
2. Navigate to Documents or Feedback tabs
3. Click on a document to open the file viewer
4. Verify no accessibility errors in console
5. Verify modal opens and displays correctly
6. Close modal and verify it disappears properly

## Related Components

- `ApplicantDrawer` - Main container component
- `ApplicantFileViewerModal` - Fixed modal component
- `Dialog` UI components from `@components/ui/dialog`

## Future Considerations

1. **Error Boundaries**: Consider adding error boundaries for better error handling
2. **Loading States**: Ensure loading states don't trigger accessibility issues
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Regular testing with screen readers and accessibility tools
4. **Component Validation**: Consider adding PropTypes or TypeScript for better type safety
