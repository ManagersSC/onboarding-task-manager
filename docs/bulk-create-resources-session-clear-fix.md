# Bulk Create Resources Session Clear Fix

## Overview
Fixed an issue where the bulk create resources form was not clearing local data and session storage when tasks were successfully created via API call.

## Problem
The bulk create resources form was storing data locally in both component state and session storage for auto-save functionality. However, when the API call to create tasks was successful, the local data was not being cleared, causing the form to retain the created tasks even after successful submission.

## Solution
Modified the `BulkCreateResourcesForm` component to clear all local data and session storage when the API call is successful, while preserving the data if the API call fails.

## Changes Made

### 1. BulkCreateResourcesForm.js
- **File**: `components/tasks/BulkCreateResourcesForm.js`
- **Change**: Modified the `handleBulkCreate` function to call `clearAllData()` after successful API response
- **Lines**: 527-528

```javascript
// Before
await onSuccess(allResources)
// Note: Session clearing is handled by parent component on success

// After  
await onSuccess(allResources)
// Clear local state and session data on successful API call
clearAllData()
```

### 2. CreateTaskDialog.js
- **File**: `components/tasks/CreateTaskDialog.js`
- **Change**: Removed duplicate session clearing logic from parent component
- **Lines**: 58-59

```javascript
// Before
// Clear session data only on successful API response
if (clearSessionData) {
  clearSessionData()
}

// After
// Note: Session clearing is now handled by BulkCreateResourcesForm component
```

## Behavior
- **On Success**: Local state and session storage are cleared, form resets to empty state
- **On Error**: Local state and session storage are preserved, allowing user to retry or modify data
- **Auto-save**: Continues to work as before, saving data every 3 seconds while user is working

## Testing
1. Create multiple resource groups with tasks
2. Submit the form successfully
3. Verify that the form clears and shows empty state
4. Test error scenario to ensure data is preserved
