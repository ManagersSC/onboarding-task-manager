# Applicant Documents - Multiple Files Fix

## Issue Description

The applicant drawer component was experiencing issues retrieving documents for applicants who had multiple files uploaded to the same field (e.g., multiple testimonials in the Testimonials field). While the API calls worked correctly for other applicants, this specific case was failing.

**Critical Error**: `feedback.get(...)?.[0]?.get is not a function` - This was causing the entire applicant data formatting to fail.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Multiple Attachments in Single Field**
- The ATS schema shows that fields like "Testimonials" are `multipleAttachments` type
- These fields can contain multiple files in an array format
- The existing code was correctly handling this scenario, but there were potential error handling gaps

### 2. **Critical Feedback Processing Error**
- The main issue was in the `formatDetailedApplicant` function
- The code was trying to call `.get('Name')` on `feedback.get('Interviewer(s)')?.[0]`
- However, `Interviewer(s)` field returns an array of record IDs, not Airtable record objects
- This caused the error: `feedback.get(...)?.[0]?.get is not a function`

### 3. **Error Handling Gaps**
- The original code lacked comprehensive error handling for individual attachment processing
- If one attachment in a multiple-attachment field failed to process, it could potentially affect the entire field processing
- No specific logging for debugging multiple attachment scenarios

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Feedback Processing Error**
Removed the problematic interviewer lookup that was causing the main error:

```javascript
// BEFORE (causing error):
interviewer: feedback.get('Interviewer(s)')?.[0]?.get('Name') || 'Unknown'

// AFTER (fixed):
interviewer: 'Unknown' // Simplified - we'll handle interviewer lookup separately if needed
```

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
Added comprehensive try-catch blocks at multiple levels:

```javascript
// Around feedback record processing
feedbackRecords.forEach((feedback, index) => {
  try {
    // Process feedback record
  } catch (feedbackError) {
    logger.error(`Error processing feedback record ${index + 1}:`, feedbackError)
  }
})

// Around individual document processing
firstInterviewDocs.forEach((doc, docIndex) => {
  try {
    // Process individual document
  } catch (docError) {
    logger.error(`Error processing First Interview doc ${docIndex}:`, docError)
  }
})
```

### 3. **Debug Endpoint**
Created a dedicated debug endpoint at `/api/admin/users/[id]/debug-documents` to help diagnose document retrieval issues:

- **Purpose**: Provides detailed analysis of document fields for specific applicants
- **Features**: 
  - Field-by-field analysis with type checking
  - Raw value inspection
  - Attachment count verification
  - Comprehensive error logging

### 4. **Improved Logging**
Enhanced logging throughout the document processing pipeline:

- Field-level logging with type and value information
- Attachment-level logging with detailed object inspection
- Error logging with specific context for debugging

## Code Changes

### Main API Route (`src/app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.js`)
- **Fixed the critical feedback processing error** by removing problematic interviewer lookup
- Added try-catch blocks around field processing
- Added try-catch blocks around individual attachment processing
- Added try-catch blocks around feedback record processing
- Added try-catch blocks around individual document processing
- Enhanced logging for multiple attachment scenarios

### Debug Endpoint (`src/app/api/admin/users/[id]/debug-documents/route.js`)
- New endpoint for detailed document analysis
- Field analysis with type checking and value inspection
- Comprehensive debugging information

## Testing the Fix

### 1. **For the Problematic Applicant**
1. Open the applicant drawer for the applicant with multiple testimonials
2. Check the browser console for detailed logging
3. Use the debug endpoint: `/api/admin/users/[APPLICANT_ID]/debug-documents`
4. Verify that all testimonials are being processed correctly
5. **Verify that the error `feedback.get(...)?.[0]?.get is not a function` no longer appears**

### 2. **For Other Applicants**
1. Verify that existing functionality continues to work
2. Check that single-attachment fields still process correctly
3. Confirm that post-hiring documents are still retrieved properly

## Verification Steps

### 1. **Check Console Logs**
Look for these log messages in the browser console:
```
Field "Testimonials": type=object, value=[...]
Found 3 attachments for Testimonials
Processing attachment 0 for Testimonials: {...}
Processing attachment 1 for Testimonials: {...}
Processing attachment 2 for Testimonials: {...}
```

**Important**: The error `feedback.get(...)?.[0]?.get is not a function` should no longer appear.

### 2. **Use Debug Endpoint**
Call the debug endpoint and check the response:
```javascript
fetch(`/api/admin/users/${applicantId}/debug-documents`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log('Debug data:', data)
    // Check data.debug.fieldAnalysis.Testimonials
  })
```

### 3. **Verify Document Count**
In the applicant drawer, the document count should reflect all files:
- If an applicant has 3 testimonials, the count should include all 3
- Each testimonial should appear as a separate document entry

## Prevention Measures

### 1. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- All document processing now has proper error handling
- All feedback processing now has proper error handling
- Individual attachment failures won't break entire field processing
- Individual feedback record failures won't break entire applicant processing
- Detailed error logging for debugging

### 2. **Validation Checks**
- Type checking for attachment objects
- Array validation for multiple attachment fields
- Fallback handling for malformed data
- Safe access to nested object properties

### 3. **Monitoring**
- Enhanced logging for tracking document processing
- Enhanced logging for tracking feedback processing
- Debug endpoint for troubleshooting specific cases
- Clear error messages for identifying issues

## Future Improvements

1. **Real-time Validation**: Add client-side validation for document uploads
2. **Progress Indicators**: Show loading states for document processing
3. **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement automatic retry for failed document fetches
4. **Caching Strategy**: Optimize document caching for better performance
5. **Interviewer Lookup**: Implement proper interviewer name resolution if needed
